Pokemon Project:
This is a project that I've been working on for fun, in order to test my skills in data analytics using SQL and Excel.
I first gathered data on everything that I could think of from the game Pokemon Black and White and created a database
with multiple tables and primary and foreign keys to link these tables together. I organized the tables in Excel, saved the 
.csv files, and uploaded them to SQL to create a database. I then created SQL queries using MySQL in order to organize the 
data into different categories based on the information I wanted to look at.
I am also planning on using R to analyze the data further, and am hoping to create some visualizations using Tableau.

Covid Project:
This is a practice project that I have been working on to work on my skills in SQL and Tableau. The data was taken from Our
World in Data, and covers Covid Deaths and Vaccinations across the world. The dataset was organized in Excel and uploaded to 
SSMS. Several queries were then run in order to look at the data according to specific requirements, such as data that correlates
to the United States. Several adjustments had to be made to that data when importing it to SSMS, as several of the numeric values
needed to be explicitly type-casted to be floats in order for the calculations to run smoothly. 
Some of the outcomes of the queries were then uploaded into Tableau to create visualizations that looked at Covid data in the 
United States.
